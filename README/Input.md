Benefit of binding component inputs to dynamic route parameter:

1. No need for injecting the ActivatedRoute into a component for accessing the dynamic route parameter.
2. Component is more reusable, because now it can be used either as a child component with where you can pass the necessary inputs or you can use the component as a new route.
